// ChuckJoke is being tasked with handling an array of jokes, which seems to be beyond the scope suggested by its name.
// For the purposes of this exercise,
// it'd be nominatively sensible to commit the cardinal sin of having App.tsx map/filter over the data to render a ChuckJoke
// for each element of the array.

// This refactor introduces some implications for how you approach the type within chuck_joke.tsx.

// I'd suggest familiarising yourself with TS's utility types: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html
// There are a whole bunch there, so to narrow your focus a little,
// particularly useful/common utility types we see in React apps are Pick, Omit and Record:

// E.g.
// If indeed our ChuckJoke component were to only need the joke string, we can 'pick' the keys we want from the existing Joke type:

// const ChuckJoke: React.FC< Pick<Joke, 'joke'> > = ( { joke } ) => ( <p> { joke } </p> )

// Pretty cool, if you ask me.
